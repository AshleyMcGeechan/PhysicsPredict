Week 9 Status Report:
* Improved LSTM design
    * More accurate one step predictions than basic model
    * Recurrent predictions less stable but show more evidence of understanding complex dynamics
    
* Studied some more literature to get ideas
    * LSTM Kalman Filter uses separate LSTM units to model noise https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01885.pdf
    * One design for learning physics from videos uses an encoder-decoder framerwork https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04681.pdf

* Started creating focused simulation test cases
    * Previous test cases were extracted from the random simulations
    * New test cases focus on specific interactions at specific points in the simulation
