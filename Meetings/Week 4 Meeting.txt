Week 4 Meeting
Config files are a success, could be applied to neural network models.
Discussed putting limits on the neural network, conclusion was no limits on data set or training time. Finished model should be fast enough to make live predictions.
Discussed implementation of an LSTM.
Need to implement better learning functions and metrics for evaluation.
Discussed further visualisation ideas.
Plan for next week is to fix issues with the training methodology and implement those further visualisations.
