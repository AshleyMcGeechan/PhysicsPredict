Week 3 Meeting
Discussed progress from last week - Simulation automation, data gathering and naive neural net implementation completed.
Discussed the results of the basic neural net and where to go from there.
Discussed choices in loss functions and metrics.
Discussed formatting of data in regards to tensor shapes and normalization.
Plans for next week were to create configuration files and scripts to automate the creation of different complexities of simulation.
Subsequent weeks would involve creating visualisation techniques to better evaluate the neural network and implementing other neural network designs like LSTM.
