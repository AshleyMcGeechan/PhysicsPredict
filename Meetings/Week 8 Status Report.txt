Week 8 Status Report:
* Continued working on LSTM
    * LSTM now reaches similar performance to feed forward network for one frame predictions
    * LSTM performs better than feed forward network for multistep predictions
    
* Increased granularity of graphing module
    * Allows for graphing error at specific points in the execution
    
* Further experimentation with LSTM
    * Progress on finding improvements is slow
    
* Fixed bugs relating to timestep, batch size, and GPU integration
