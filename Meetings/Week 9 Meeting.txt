Week 9 Meeting:
* Discussed the progress made in the LSTM model, improving past the previous ceiling
* Discussed further avenues of improvement, loss function that optimises on recurrent predictions, unraveling the LSTM
* Discussed further areas of exploration like Convolutional Neural Networks
* Discussed the content of the project (simulator, data set, predictors, evaluation tools)
* Discussed what was missing from the project (concrete evaluation)
* Current plan is to try and improve the stability of recurrent predictions and then move on to alternate models
