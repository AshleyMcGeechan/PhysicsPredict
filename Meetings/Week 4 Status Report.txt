Week 4 Status Report


* Config files created
   * YAML format
   * Allows easy editing of all variables related to simulation complexity
   * Allows you to specify a range of values for randomisation
   * Simulation code refactored to allow this


* Example configs made
   * Examples span a range of complexity from 1 ball with no friction to 8 balls of random sizes
   * Further complexity can be added
   * Can be plugged straight into the simulator


* Expanded data set and refined neural network
   * Dataset now around 50k pairs of frames


* Predictor module made
   * Takes one new simulation run and outputs two simulated runs, one where predictions are made one frame ahead and one where all frames are predicted recursively using the initial 2 frames


* Visualiser created
   * Takes 3 runs (the ones created using the predictor) and visualises them side by side for comparison
