Week 2 Meeting:
Discussed the research papers. Graph Networks would be an interesting place to possibly take the project in later stages. Hierarchical Networks out of scope.
Discussed altering parameters and creating other simulators to generalise the model to more problems and see where the model fails.
Discussed structuring of the neural network in regards to inputs and outputs and recurrence.
Discussed visualisation techniques for evaluation e.g feeding outputs back into the simulator for visual recreation and comparison.
Plan is to have a basic neural network that will support input and output by next week.
