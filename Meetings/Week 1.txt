Discussed research and preparation done over the summer.
Re-established mutual understanding of project aims and goals.
Discussed the ideas I had come up with in regards to the physics engine.
In brief, a model that can accurately predict the state of future frames using data straight from the physics engine itself would be sufficient.
Stretch goals would be to determine data visually from images of the engine and to re-create images using the predicted data.
Set goals for Week 1 - Make a 24 week plan, create a mindmap encompassing all my thoughts related to the project, set up version control and software, create a report of what was done over the summer, study the research papers provided.
