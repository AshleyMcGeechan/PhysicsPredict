Week 5 Status Report:
	* Fixed the training methodology
		* Validation and Test sets now separated by run
		
	* Static Trajectory Plotting module made
		* Creates plots of simulated as well as predicted data
		* Supports different combinations of data allowing for overlayed and faceted views
		
	* Experimented with model hyperparameters to solve oscillation problem
		* Root of the problem was due to the model quickly accelerating balls and then modelling the resulting collision with walls
		* Adjusting batch size, learning rate, dataset size, activation functions, etc all have an effect on this
		* Models that deal better with collisions have more problems with oscillation
