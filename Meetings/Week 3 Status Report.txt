Week 3 Status Report
Data gathering is fully automated with each run outputting a file with the x and y positions of each ball on each frame. Average run lasts 400 frames running at 60 frames per second.
Sample test data of ~50 runs and ~20000 frames generated to test the neural net.
Data preprocessed into triplet pairs of frames for processing by the neural network.
Basic naive neural net implemented, taking two frames of data as input, passing through some dense layers and predicting output positions for the next frame. Results reaches around 95% accuracy.
