* The possible space of a physical system scales exponentially with the number of elements
* One solution is to define systems in terms of objects and relations like particles and forces
* To learn these systems we introduce a bias for objects and relation representations
* This takes the form of graph networks which encode objects as nodes in the graph and relations as edges.
* The global constants are learned and encoded in the global update function.
* The network learned to make predictions on seven simulated systems and one real world system
* The network has no initial knowledge of the physical laws of the system but learns to approximate them by observing the objects and relations.
* GN based models are most successful when there is commonality between the objects and relations to share.
* Model does not address the compounding factors of errors across long trajectory predictions.
